This module was created using the Search API Statistics GSoC '12 Project (http://drupal.org/sandbox/mtee/1614882)
as a starting point, and then customizing to fit our needs.  

Key customizations include:

- Tracks entire search terms, in addition to individual keywords
  - Changed the 'value' column to length 255 in order to accomodate

- Fixed major bug with mismatching tokens in the sapistats_js_callback() function
  - customize strings in sapistats_getPrivateKey() and sapistats_getHashSalt() to suit your needs

- Removed the sapistats_aggregator submodule

- Added the module within sapistats is called ubc_sapistats_views, and has replaced the Views originally provided by sapistats.
Enable both modules and click the Configure option in sapistats in order to track your Search API Index.

- Removed attempt to log URL Query filters to DB


A code review was also performed by Valerie and Dave.


*************************************************************************
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL README TO CAME WITH THE SAPISTATS PROJECT:

Module closely integrates with Search and Facet APIs, 
it logs search queries (keywords and facets) and provides site maintainers
with a visual representation of the collected data, which can be shown as
a simple list in a block or as a chart.
It integrates here with the Views module.
Some usage-scenarios:

How many results did a search facet have yesterday?
How many 30 days ago?
How did the popularity of a facet evolve over time?
Do people actually use the facets Iâ€™m exposing on my site?
How often has this particular facet been clicked on today?
How often is the whole search used anyway in a given time period?
What are the most trending search terms compared to last week?
Which facet has been relegated or is used less often?

A user will be able to set up the time period for which data will be stored.
Granularity of reports will be also adjustable.
This data after evaluation could be published on the site,
for instance the most searched jobs may be listed on a job search portal.
